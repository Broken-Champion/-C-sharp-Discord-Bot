# C-Discord-Bot
///This is an open-source C# bot.
///No functions have yet been added to the bot and so this is just the code handler to get it online and keep it so, as long as you have a server to run it, which can as well be your own personal machine.
/// over time I will make sure I add as many functions as possible after making sure they have worked with the real thing.
/// If you are to use the code, make sure you replace the fake token in the file with the real token of your bot, otherwise it won't connect or work.
